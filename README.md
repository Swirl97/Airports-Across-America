<h1> <span>&#9992;</span> Airports Across America <span>&#9992;</span> </h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

In the `airports.geojson` file there is a field `CNTL_TWR` which indicates if the airport has an air traffic control tower present. It is useful when wanting to do airport communications or air control. 

<p>This map displays all the airports in the contiguous United States of America in 2012.</p>
